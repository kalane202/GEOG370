<h1>Homework 6 Pt 2: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Kathleen Lane</h2>
<h3>
    The ratio that I made is the number of people without a high school degree per 1,000 people by each
    county in Virginia. I made this calculation by dividing the number of people without a high school degree 
    in a county by the total population in that county. I chose to do a ratio because ratios are a better 
    representation on a choropleth than raw counts. Raw counts will be affected by population and county size. 
    For example, you would expect a larger county to have more people without a high school degree purely 
    because there is a larger population in that county. However, ratios allow us to compare two counties by
    accounting for the size differences.

    This map shows a choropleth categorized by natural breaks. Natural breaks are a good option for larger datasets
    and they help us to see outliers very well. For example, we can see that the dark green counties on this map are the few
    counties with the largest population of adults without a high school degree out of all of the counties, a.k.a
    outliers. Natural breaks also create a good representation of all classes on a map. Here we can clearly see each
    class represented. However, natural breaks creates unequal bin sizes in the legend classes that make it harder to 
    compare counties in different classes. For example, the bin size of the lightest legend class is 35, whereas the 
    bin size of the darkest legend class is 79.

<h3>
    This map shows a choropleth categorized by equal intervals. Equal intervals create classes that increase by the
    same interval. In this map, the legend classes increase by 47. These even increments solve the drawback of natural
    breaks by creating equal and comparable bin sizes while still being a map that exemplifies outliers. We can see that
    the dark green counties have exceptionally high proportions of adults without a high school degree. However, you can
    see that there are many lighter color counties and that there isn't as great of a representation of all of the
    different classes as there is in natural breaks. This issue is because equal interval has the drawback of not being
    able to distinguish well between counties with smaller ratios. Thebiggest drawback with equal interval is that not
    all classes are guaranteed to be represented.
