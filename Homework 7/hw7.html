<h1>Homework 7: Make a Choropleth or Proportional Symbol Map </h1>
<h2>Kathleen Lane</h2>
<h3>
    Below is a map of the lower 48 states in the United States and their associated cancer mortality rates.
    It is important to note that this data is from 2021 and the values are given per 100,000 people. I chose
    to exclude Hawaii and Alaska for visual purposes, though the vector file given below includes those
    states. Additionally, I chose to make a map of cancer mortality rates because it is highly relevant in 
    my life. In the past year and a half, I have lost two loved ones to cancer. Additionally, I am a part of
    an organization at UNC that aims to serve children whose parents have been affected by cancer. Cancer
    is relevant in many of our lives, and I think this map is helpful to identify where its effects are most
    prevalent.
