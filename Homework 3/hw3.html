    <h3>Above is a Pseudo-Mercator map projection. The yellow dots on the map are the Tissot's indicatrix. 
        These circles demonstrate how well the map projection maintains the shape and area of an item on a map.
        You can see in this map that the circles are all roughly the same circular shape. The closer these 
        shapes are to circles, the closer the land masses on the map are to their actual shape. It is evident
        that the Pseudo-Mercator projection is maintaining the correct shapes of the land masses. However, you
        also need to consider the size of the circles. The size of the circles represents the area of the
        items on the map. We can see on this map that the circles increase closer to the poles. This means
        that the land closer to the poles is portrayed as a larger area in this projection than it is in 
        real life. For example, Greenland and Russia are larger on this map in relation to other countries like 
        the US than they actually are in real life. In conclusion, the Pseudo-Mercator map is good to reference
        to understand the shapes of continents and countries on a world map. However, by maintaining shape so well,
        this map projection sacrifices an accurate view of continent and country size.

    <h3>Above is a Robinson map projection. The Robinson map projection differs from the Mercator projection
        because it finds a balance of maintaining both shape and size. It does not sacrifice one of those
        attributes more than the other. In the center of the map, you can see that the indicatrix is made up
        of roughly uniform oblong shapes. The shape is not perfectly a circle, indicating a slight distortion in the area/size
        of the countinents and countries. Then, as you move closer to the poles, you can see that the size of the 
        indicatrix shapes slightly increase and the shapes becomes slightly more circular. This shape change indicates
        a slight increase in area representation but a better shape representation near the poles. This distinction
        in distortion between the middle and the edge of the map projection exemplifies the balance of maintaining
        shape and area.
