    <img width = 700px src="./Images/PseudoMercator.png" alt="mercator map">
    <h3>Above is a Pseudo-Mercator map projection. The yellow dots on the map are the Tissot's indicatrix. 
        These circles demonstrate how well the map projection maintains the shape and area of an item on a map.
        You can see in this map that the circles are all roughly the same circular shape. The closer these 
        shapes are to circles, the closer the land masses on the map are to their actual shape. It is evident
        that the Pseudo-Mercator projection is maintaining the correct shapes of the land masses. However, you
        also need to consider the size of the circles. The size of the circles represents the area of the
        items on the map. We can see on this map that the circles increase closer to the poles. This means
        that the land closer to the poles is portrayed as a larger area in this projection than it is in 
        real life. For example, Greenland and Russia are larger on this map in relation to other countries like 
        the US than they actually are in real life. In conclusion, the Pseudo-Mercator map is good to reference
        to understand the shapes of continents and countries on a world map. However, by maintaining shape so well,
        this map projection sacrifices an accurate view of continent and country size.

    <img width = 700px src="./Images/RobinsonPrj.png" alt="robinson map">
    <h3>Above is a Robinson map projection. The Robinson map projection differs from the Mercator projection
        because it finds a balance of maintaining both shape and size. It does not sacrifice one of those
        attributes more than the other. In the center of the map, you can see that the indicatrix is made up
        of roughly uniform oblong shapes. The shape is not perfectly a circle, indicating a slight distortion in the area/size
        of the countinents and countries. Then, as you move closer to the poles, you can see that the size of the 
        indicatrix shapes slightly increase and the shapes becomes slightly more circular. This shape change indicates
        a slight increase in area representation but a better shape representation near the poles. This distinction
        in distortion between the middle and the edge of the map projection exemplifies the balance of maintaining
        shape and area.

    <img width = 700px src="./Images/GoodesHomolosine.png" alt="goodeshomolosine map">
    <h3>Above is a Goode's Homolosine map projection. You can see that the shape and size of the circles are 
        fairly consistent over land masses to keep the area and shape of them accurate. However, the circles become
        highly distorted over the oceans and near the poles. This map does a good job of prioritizing where to 
        conserve shape and area. It is not as important in the oceans or at the poles.</h3>
    <img width = 700px src="./Images/Winkel53018.png" alt="winkel map">
    <h3>Above is a Winkel map projection (projection 53018). This projection is very similar to the Robinson 
        projection in that it balances maintaining the shape and sizes of land masses. The shapes of the circles are
        more distorted near the poles, meaning that the shapes of those land masses will be less accurate. The size
        of the circles is fairly consistent throughout.
    </h3>
    <img width = 700px src="./Images/54034.png" alt="54034 map">
    <h3>Above is a cylindrical map projection (projection 54034). This projection conserves the size of the circles well
        but greatly sacrifices the shape of the circles near the poles. So, land area should be fairly accurate but the 
        true shape of the landmasses is greatly distorted as you move further north and south of the equator.
    </h3>
    <img width = 700px src="./Images/54027.png" alt="54027 map">
    <h3>Above is a conic map projection (projection 54027). This projection preserves neither shape nor size of landmasses. 
        This is evident as the circles become oblong and larger as you move to the circular edge of the projection. This 
        projection is mostly helpful to visualize what earth would look like from a bird's-eye view.
    </h3>
    <img width = 700px src="./Images/102016.png" alt="102016 map">
    <h3>Above is a azimuthal map projection (projection 102016). This projection is highly similar to the conical projection
        above in that it doesn't conserve shape or size of landmasses well. The only difference is that the landmasses in the 
        azimuthal projection are closer together than those in the conical projection.
    </h3>
    <img width = 700px src="./Images/4326.png" alt="4326 map">
    <h3>Above is a WGS 84 map projection (projection 4326). The shapes of the landmasses closer to the equator are very accurate,
        as shown by the circular shapes. However, the size and shape distorts at the poles. Seemingly shape more than size.
    </h3>
    <img width = 700px src="./Images/53016.png" alt="53016 map">
    <h3>Above is a Gall-Peters map projection (projection 53016). This projection is similar to the WGS 84 projection in that
        size and shape distorts at the poles. Seemingly shape more than size. However, the shapes of the landmasses closer to the
        equator aren't as accurate as those in WGS 84. This is exemplified by the ovular shapes in the middle horizontal strip of the map.
    </h3> </h3>

    <h1>In Summary</h1>
    <h3>I found these commonly used map projections in the project coordinate reference system (CRS) portion 
        on QGIS. Some of these projections were recommended and others were found using an online article naming the 
        top 10 world map projections (https://futuremaps.com/blogs/news/top-10-world-map-projections). As mentioned
        in the paragraphs above, Tissot's Indicatrix was placed on top of each of these projections. These circles 
        demonstrate how well the map projection maintains the shape and area of an item on a map. The more distorted
        the shape is from a circle, the less accurate the land mass shapes are in that portion of the map. The size of
        the circles demonstrate how well the map projection portrays a land mass's area size. Varying circle sizes
        mean variance of a land mass's area from the true area. </h3>
